# Introduction

- **Primary Processes:** Main manufacturing takes place
	- Casting
	- Forming
	- Machining
	- Welding

- **Secondary Processes:** Refining of the material takes place

**Casting** is a zero process (constant material)
**Forming** is a zero process (constant material)
**Machining** is a negative process (removal of material)

**Welding** can be a positive process or a zero process depending on the fact whether filler material is used or not. 

**Definition:** Welding is a process in which metals are joined at surfaces by the virtue of heat and/or pressure. Additional filler material may or may not be required. 

Welding can be done in **flat (down hand), overhead, horizontal or vertical positions**.

## Advantages
- It provides a permanent joint
- Welded joint is generally equal or stronger in strength compared to the parent metal. Usually, a similar type of material is used as the filler material.
- It is very economical

# Types of Welding

## Fusion welding
- Heat is applied to melt the base metal. Filler metal is generally used. 
- If no filler metal is used, then it is called **Autogenous Weld**.
